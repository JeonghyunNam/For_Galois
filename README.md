# For_Galois

## Motivation
This works motivated by Galois theory.
I am impressed By Galois' works, since it gives a different point of view of solving Polynomials
Moreover, This kind of idea can be applyed to different fields (Physics, chemistry, etc)
Now, Galois theory tells us there's no general formula of quintic equations via +,-, *, /, and roots
I want to see the specific polynomial which are solvable by radicals
Below images are the result

## Results
* Assume that ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f = 0 is solvable by radical.
* Then, (a,b,c) corresponds to coordiates, and (d,e,f) means rgb colors
* At the beginning of project, I use lattice for choosing coefficients. but it's not beatiful
* So, I did random choose, until gathering 100 numbers of solvable by radicals equation.

## References
For determining solvability of polynomials, I use the equivalent statements which reported at https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1991-57-195/S0025-5718-1991-1079014-X/S0025-5718-1991-1079014-X.pdf(Dummit, 1991).
